# Lancer — Cursor Rules

## About the User

Jack is a non-technical founder. He has great product instincts and design taste, but he's new to coding. Explain what you're doing and why. Use plain language. Use business analogies when helpful.

## Project Context

This is the Lancer landing page and web app — a marketplace connecting skilled workers with homeowners. Read `CLAUDE.md` for full project context, current state, and tech details.

## Tech Stack Rules

- **Next.js 16** with App Router (`app/` directory)
- **TypeScript** for all code
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS, NOT a tailwind.config.js
- **React 19** — Server Components by default, `'use client'` only when needed
- **Geist Sans** font (already configured in layout.tsx)

## Code Style

- Functional components with hooks
- One component per file
- Files under 200 lines (split if larger)
- Use the `@/` path alias for imports (maps to `src/`)
- Comment the "why" not the "what"
- Handle loading, error, and empty states in all interactive components

## Design System

Follow the established design patterns — don't introduce new colors or styles without checking CLAUDE.md's Design System section first.

- **Primary:** emerald-600 / emerald-500
- **Text:** slate-900 (headings), slate-600 (body)
- **Backgrounds:** white and slate-50 (alternating sections)
- **Components:** rounded-2xl cards, rounded-full buttons, generous padding
- **Layout:** max-w-7xl container, mobile-first responsive

## Component Patterns

- Section components go in `src/components/sections/`
- Form components go in `src/components/forms/`
- Shared UI components go in `src/components/ui/` (create as needed)
- Utility functions go in `src/lib/`
- Type definitions go in `src/types/`
- Custom hooks go in `src/hooks/`

## When Writing Code

- Prefer simple over clever
- Use Tailwind classes, never inline styles or CSS modules
- Use Next.js `<Image>` for images, `<Link>` for internal navigation
- Use `<a>` with `href="#section"` for same-page anchor links
- Always test responsive: mobile → tablet → desktop
- Run `npm run build` before saying you're done

## Agent System

This project uses agents defined in `docs/agents/`. Each agent has a specific role. Before starting work, read:
1. This file (auto-read by Cursor)
2. `CLAUDE.md` (auto-read by Claude)
3. The relevant agent prompt in `docs/agents/`
4. The relevant workflow in `docs/workflows/`

## Git Rules

- Always work on a feature branch (never commit directly to main)
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `content:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- Commit at natural save points
- Push after every commit
- Create PRs for Jack to review — he merges in GitHub
- Never commit `.env.local`, `data/`, or `node_modules/`

## When Jack Says...

- **"Update the copy"** → Content changes only, use Content Editor workflow
- **"Make it look better"** → Styling/design changes, use Content Editor workflow
- **"Add [feature]"** → Full feature workflow: research → plan → review → build → code review
- **"Ship it"** → Create PR, get it merged, verify Amplify deployment
- **"How does this work?"** → Explain with business analogies, be patient
